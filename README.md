## Why?

- Certain data (e.g. deponent name & case number) are repeated 4-5 times in the header, endorsement and backsheet of an affirmation.
- Enter the data once and the repetitions are automatically generated here.
- Lawyers can use this to quickly create a bare bones first draft / check the repetitions before filing.
  
## User story

1. Users: HK lawyers and clerks; law students and teachers.
2. User fills in the boxes, click the only button "Output".
3. The heading, endorsement and the backsheet are generated.  An "Input" button  takes the user back for modifications as appropriate.
